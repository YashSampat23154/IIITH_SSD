I have used javascript to provide validation to the various elements entered by the user.

ValidateEmail = To check the email.
ValidateUsername = To check the username.
ValidatePassword = To compare the two passwords.
ValidateTeamLead = To ensure the team lead is a valid entry.
checkAll = To check all the properties before the user submits the code.
